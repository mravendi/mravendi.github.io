# Playing with Loss Functions in Deep Learning

In this post, we are going to be developing custom loss functions in deep learning applications
such as semantic segmentation. We use Python 2.7 and Keras 2.x for implementation.

## Standard Loss Function
Loss Functions are at the heart of any learning-based algorithm. We convert the learning problem
into an optimization problem, define a loss function and then optimize the algorithm to minimize the loss function.
