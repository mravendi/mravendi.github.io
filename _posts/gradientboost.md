# Gradient Boosting


Boosting is a general technique to create an ensemble of models. In boosting, we fit a sequence of models by giving more weight to the records with large residuals.
The most widely used boosting algorithm is called stochastic gradient boosting. In this algorithm, the sucessive models are fitted on sub-samples of data and features.
