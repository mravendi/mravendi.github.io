# ML Tips and Tricks: Learning Rate Schedules

The machine learning and data science fields are based on some fundamentals and many tips and tricks. 
In these series of posts, I will be posting some of these tips and tricks. 


## Learning Rate Schedules 
Typically, to develop an ML/DL algorithm using SGD, the following ingredients are required:

- Training data (inputs and targets)
- a model 
- an objective function
- an optimizer

You can see the interaction between these elements in the following diagram:
